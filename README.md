## üëÄ Overview
Yoda is an experimental network server using AF_XDP, eBPF, and a userspace TCP/IP stack (gVisor). It provides stealth remote shell access via websocket, advanced packet filtering, process and file hiding, and supports remote commands such as download, upload, and more. All networking (TCP/IP) is handled outside the Linux kernel, entirely in userspace.



## ‚ú® Features

- **AF_XDP Packet I/O:** High-performance userspace packet capture and injection.
- **eBPF/XDP Integration:** Advanced filtering and stealth via custom eBPF programs.
- **gVisor Netstack:** Full userspace TCP/IP stack, kernel bypass for all networking.
- **mTLS/WebSocket PTY Shell:** Secure, stealth remote shell access over mutual TLS and WebSocket.
-- **Native Remote Commands:** Built-in support for commands such as download, upload, ls, ps, cat, rm, etc.
- **Process, Binary & Networking Hiding:** eBPF hooks to hide processes, binaries, files, and network activity.
- **Log Output Cleaning:** Suppresses kernel warnings and traces in dmesg and journalctl.
- **XDP Stealth:** XDP program attachment hidden from ip link output.


## ‚ö° Quick Start

Requirements

You need the following to build Yoda:

- **Linux** (kernel 5.4+ recommended)
- **Go 1.20+**
- **Python 3**
- **Clang/LLVM, libbpf-dev, bpftool, make**
- **Root privileges** (required for AF_XDP, eBPF)


On Ubuntu/Debian, install the required packages with:
```sh
sudo apt-get install clang llvm libbpf-dev bpftool make golang python3 build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

To generate the `vmlinux.h` header (required for eBPF CO-RE):
```sh
bpftool btf dump file /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux format c > /same/dir/as/eBPF_prog/vmlinux.h
```

### MAC Signature Tool
```sh
python3 gen_mac_sig.py 0x4242 10
python3 gen_mac_sig.py --mac aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
```

### Build & Run
Before building, edit `config.go` and `xdp_redirect.c` as needed to match your environment or requirements (e.g., network interface, MAC signature, ports, IP addr).

```sh
# First generate mtls certs for cli & yoda
make cert CERT_IP=IP_OF_YODA_SERV # Same ip as netLocalIP in config.go

make bpf        # Build eBPF programs
make yoda       # Build Yoda server
make cli        # Build Yoda client
make all        # Build all
sudo bin/yoda   # Run server
```

### Test

> [!WARNING]  
> The client **must** be run from another physical machine on your LAN.  
> Packets must arrive on the actual physical network interface monitored by XDP.  
> Traffic from Docker containers, localhost, or most VMs usually does **not** reach the physical NIC and will **not** trigger the XDP program.  
> For reliable testing, always use a separate physical client machine.

On the client side use yoda cli and enjoy
```sh
./yoda-client help
```

## üß© XDP Filter

Yoda uses advanced XDP filtering to select which packets to process:

- **MAC signature filtering (XOR):** The XDP C program (`bpf/xdp_redirect.c`) checks for a weak-collision signature on MAC source addresses (XOR over 4 bytes) and configured port. Only packets with a matching MAC signature / port are accepted; others are passed normally to the linux kernel.
- **Compatible MAC generation:** The Python script `tools/gen_mac_sig.py` generates MAC addresses that match the expected XOR signature for the server or give you the signature of yours.

## üïµÔ∏è Stealth & Hiding

- **Kernel Bypass:** Packets are processed directly in userspace, never entering the kernel TCP/IP stack.
- **No visible connections:** No visible connections in `netstat`, `ss`, or `lsof`.
- **Firewall/tcpdump bypass:** Yoda-handled packets bypass Netfilter and conntrack, ignoring iptables rules and remaining invisible to tcpdump and standard network monitors. 
- **Process & Binary Hiding:** Yoda uses an eBPF hook on the `getdents64` syscall to hide its own PIDs, shell PID and binary name from process listings. This means the process and its executable will not appear in `ls`, `ps`, `top`, `htop`, `find` or similar tools, making detection much harder.
- **Files & Directory Hiding:** Yoda can also hide files and directories whose names start with a configured prefix.
- **Traffic camouflage:** Yoda doesn‚Äôt bind ports normally but uses AF_XDP to capture only matching packets in userspace. Legitimate traffic (e.g., Apache on port 443) passes through unaffected, letting Yoda blend seamlessly and avoid detection.
- **Log output cleaning:** Kernel warnings and traces related to eBPF actions (e.g., bpf_probe_write_user) are cleaned from `dmesg` and `journalctl` output.
- **Ip link output cleaning:** No XDP program is shown as attached in `ip link` output for the interface.
- **Advanced stealth:** Perfect for scenarios requiring maximum network discretion.. üëª

## üìù TODO
- **Add extended commands (such as download, upload, etc.)**
- **Add a mechanism to handle several types of stealth persistence.**
- **Add uprobe hooks for various TLS/OPENSSL libraries (SSL_READ/WRITE)**
- **Add uprobe hooks on bash readline() and other shell equivalents**
- **Add uprobe hooks on pam_get_authtok to sniff PAM logon passwords**
- ~~Hide the Yoda process and executable from commands like ps, ls, top, etc., by hooking the getdents*() syscalls.~~
- ~~Add a custom client for improved functionality.~~
- ~~Suppress or hide kernel warnings related to bpf_probe_write_user in dmesg and other system logs.~~ 
- ~~Hide XDP program information from appearing in the output of the ip link command. sendmsg()? write() ?~~
