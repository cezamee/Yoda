## üëÄ Overview

Yoda is an experimental network server using AF_XDP, eBPF, and a userspace TCP/IP stack (gVisor netstack). It provides stealth remote shell access using websocket, advanced packet filtering, and process hiding. All networking (TCP/IP) is handled outside the Linux kernel, entirely in userspace.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AF_XDP Packet I/O**
- **eBPF/XDP Integration**
- **gVisor Netstack** 
- **mTLS/Websocket PTY Shell**
- **Process, Binary & Networking Hiding**
- **dmesg & journalctl log output cleaning**
- **ip link output does not reveal XDP program attachment**

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### üóÉÔ∏è Requirements

You need the following to build Yoda:

- **Linux** (kernel 5.4+ recommended)
- [**Go 1.20+**](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [**Protobuf-compiler**](https://protobuf.dev/installation/)
- [**Python 3**](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Clang/LLVM, libbpf-dev, bpftool, make**
- **Root privileges** (required for AF_XDP, eBPF)

On Ubuntu/Debian, install the required packages:

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install clang llvm libbpf-dev bpftool make golang python3 build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

For bpftool, install one of the available packages:

```sh
# Choose one based on your kernel version
$ sudo apt-get install linux-hwe-6.5-tools-common
# or default
$ sudo apt-get install linux-hwe-6.2-tools-common
```

Navigate to the project directory and generate the required eBPF header:

To generate the `vmlinux.h` header (required for eBPF CO-RE):
```sh
$ pwd
/home/cezame/Yoda/
$ bpftool btf dump file /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux format c > vmlinux.h
```

> [!WARNING]
> WSL2 has limited eBPF support. If the above commands fail:
> Download a compatible vmlinux.h and install the required tools manually.
> ```sh
> $ curl -o vmlinux.h https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libbpf/libbpf/refs/heads/master/.github/actions/build-selftests/vmlinux.h
> $ sudo apt-get install linux-hwe-6.5-tools-common
> ```

### ·ù∞.·êü MAC Signature Tool

Yoda uses a weak-collision MAC signature to filter packets. The Python script `tools/gen_mac_sig.py` generates compatible MAC addresses or retrieves the signature for a given MAC address.
You can generate a MAC address with a specific signature or retrieve the signature for an existing MAC address.

```sh
$ pwd
/home/cezame/Yoda/tools
$ python3 gen_mac_sig.py 0x4242 10
$ python3 gen_mac_sig.py --mac aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Build & Run

Before building, edit `internal/config/config.go` and `bpf/xdp_redirect.c` as needed to match your environment or requirements (e.g., network interface, MAC signature, ports, IP addr).

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Configure ``internal/config/config.go``

##### Network Settings
Before building Yoda, you need to configure the network parameters in ``config/config.go`` to match your environment:

```go
const (
    NetLocalIP    = "192.168.0.38" // Your local IP address
    NetGateway    = "192.168.0.1"  // Your gateway IP
    InterfaceName = "enp46s0"      // Your network interface name
    TcpListenPort = 443            // TCP port for C2 communication
    UdpListenPort = 443            // UDP port for C2 communication
)
```

Finding Your Network Information
1. Get Your Local IP Address
    ```sh
    # Method 1: Using ip command
    $ ip route get 8.8.8.8 | grep -oP 'src \K\S+'
     
    # Method 2: Using hostname command
    $ hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
     
    # Method 3: Check specific interface
    $ ip addr show | grep 'inet ' | grep -v '127.0.0.1'
    ```
2. Find Your Gateway IP
    ```sh
    # Method 1: Using ip command
    $ ip route | grep default | awk '{print $3}'
    
    # Method 2: Using route command
    $ route -n | grep 'UG[ \t]' | awk '{print $2}'
    ```

3. Identify Your Network Interface
    ```sh
    # List all network interfaces
    $ ip link show

    # Show interfaces with IP addresses
    $ ip addr show

    # Find active interface (excluding loopback)
    $ ip route | grep default | awk '{print $5}'
    ```

> [!WARNING]
> 
> Ensure the configured IP matches your actual network setup
> Wrong interface names will cause AF_XDP socket binding to fail
> The gateway IP must be reachable from your local network

```sh
# First generate mtls certs for cli & yoda
make cert CERT_IP=IP_OF_YODA_SERV # Same ip as netLocalIP in config.go

make bpf        # Build eBPF programs
make yoda       # Build Yoda server
make cli        # Build Yoda client
make all        # Build all
sudo bin/yoda   # Run server
```

### Test

> [!WARNING]  
> The client **must** be run from another physical machine on your LAN.  
> Packets must arrive on the actual physical network interface monitored by XDP.  
> Traffic from Docker containers, localhost, or most VMs usually does **not** reach the physical NIC and will **not** trigger the XDP program.  
> For reliable testing, always use a separate physical client machine.

On the client side use yoda cli and enjoy
```sh
./yoda-client shell
```

## üß© XDP Filter

Yoda uses advanced XDP filtering to select which packets to process:

- **MAC signature filtering (XOR):** The XDP C program (`bpf/xdp_redirect.c`) checks for a weak-collision signature on MAC source addresses (XOR over 4 bytes) and configured port. Only packets with a matching MAC signature / port are accepted; others are passed normally to the linux kernel.
- **Compatible MAC generation:** The Python script `tools/gen_mac_sig.py` generates MAC addresses that match the expected XOR signature for the server or give you the signature of yours.

## üïµÔ∏è Stealth & Hiding

- **Kernel Bypass:** Packets are processed directly in userspace, never entering the kernel TCP/IP stack.
- **No visible connections:** No visible connections in `netstat`, `ss`, or `lsof`.
- **Firewall/tcpdump bypass:** Yoda-handled packets bypass Netfilter and conntrack, ignoring iptables rules and remaining invisible to tcpdump and standard network monitors. 
- **Process & Binary Hiding:** Yoda uses an eBPF hook on the `getdents64` syscall to hide its own PIDs, shell PID and binary name from process listings. This means the process and its executable will not appear in `ls`, `ps`, `top`, `htop`, `find` or similar tools, making detection much harder.
- **Files & Directory Hiding:** Yoda can also hide files and directories whose names start with a configured prefix.
- **Traffic camouflage:** Yoda doesn‚Äôt bind ports normally but uses AF_XDP to capture only matching packets in userspace. Legitimate traffic (e.g., Apache on port 443) passes through unaffected, letting Yoda blend seamlessly and avoid detection.
- **Log output cleaning:** Kernel warnings and traces related to eBPF actions (e.g., bpf_probe_write_user) are cleaned from `dmesg` and `journalctl` output.
- **Ip link output cleaning:** No XDP program is shown as attached in `ip link` output for the interface.
- **Advanced stealth:** Perfect for scenarios requiring maximum network discretion.. üëª
